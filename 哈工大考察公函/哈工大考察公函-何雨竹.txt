We are the team of Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications which is also studying the cubesat .So I am writing to apply for admission to your university for further investigation .we quite want to use your previous experience for reference .
  Here is the further information .we are especially interested about how to establish a good gesture and attitude control system. we actually are having some problems in this aspect, especially the directed operations when we perform a task. In the aspect of calculating the orbit lifetime ,we are also having troubles in the average cross-sectional area. we have read paper times and times about calculating, but there are still some challenge in some definition and figures. it°Øs really a little difficult for us to understand all the formula and so on. There are also some other this kind of questions ,we would be very happy if we could solve them by this investigation.  
  If you could give us permission and offer help to us ,we would appreciate it very much.as for this investigation, we decide to send six members to present us to get the more information about these questions.they are xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx and our great leader xxx.
